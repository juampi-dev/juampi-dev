# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me 
Hi! I'm Juan Pablo (but you can call me Juan or Juampi), a passionate programmer. I love computers, programming, video games, music, traveling, astronomy, soccer and spending time with my loved ones.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects: my personal portfolio and a web application that is called "Betelgeuse Status" and shows updated data about that star.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the backend side of "Betelgeuse Status".
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java.

## Education
- I am currently studying QA + Automation at Globant University / EGG Cooperation. QA stands for Quality Assurance, which involves ensuring the quality and reliability of software through testing and automation.
- During my studies, I have acquired knowledge in Web Development (specially Frontend), Cloud Computing and Software development & testing.
- I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and improve my technical skills.

## Featured Projects
Here are some examples of the projects I have been working on recently:

1. **[Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://github.com/juan-ps/frontend-mentor-challenges)**: A collection of web components that I developed based on the challenges from Frontend Mentor. These projects not only allowed me to enhance my frontend skills and implement best practices but also provided an opportunity to learn and utilize Next.js and TypeScript in a more comprehensive manner.

2. **[QA - Globant - Egg](https://github.com/juan-ps/qaGlobantEgg)**: A series of exercises and challenges from the QA + Automation course at Globant University / EGG Cooperation. This course provided me with a solid foundation in programming, allowing me to reinforce my programming logic and knowledge. Additionally, it offered a detailed exploration of Java, enabling me to gain a deeper understanding of the language.

Feel free to explore these repositories and check out their respective README files for detailed information about their content and my approach to each project.

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Technologies and Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Figma, Node.js, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Git, AWS Services.
- **Development Methodologies**: I am open to learning and applying various development approaches in my projects, adapting as needed to ensure efficiency and quality throughout the development process.
